## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source files using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt your data.

## Encryption Methods

### 1. CypherS Encryption

This method encrypts the data using the CypherS algorithm, which shifts each character by a certain number of positions.

### 2. XOR Encryption

XOR encryption uses the XOR operation to encrypt the data, providing a simple but effective encryption technique.

### 3. CSX Encryption

CSX encryption combines CypherS and XOR encryption methods to enhance security.

### 4. SX Encryption

SX encryption is another combination method, utilizing XOR and CypherS encryption.

## Decryption Methods

### 1. CypherS Dccryption

This method decrypts the data using the CypherS algorithm, which again shifts each character by a certain number of positions to get the original data.

### 2. XOR Dccryption

XOR decryption uses the same XOR operation to decrypt the data.

### 3. CSX Dccryption

CSX encryption combines CypherS and XOR methods to decrypt the data.

### 4. SX Decryption

SX decryption is another combination method, utilizing XOR and CypherS methods to decrypt the data.
